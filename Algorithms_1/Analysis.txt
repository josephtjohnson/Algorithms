Task 0
# Run time analysis - O(1). The run time does not change with the input.

Task 1
# Run time analysis - O(n). This is because of the two, non-nested for loops.

Task 2
# Run time analysis - O(n). This is because of the single for loop.

Task 3
# Run time analysis - O(n log n). O(n) is dominated by the O(n log n) due to sorted() to the point that it is not considered in the analysis.

Task 4
# Run time analysis - O(n log n). O(n) is dominated by the O(n log n) due to sorted() to the point that it is not considered in the analysis.
